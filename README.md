## Requirements

### 1. User Authentication

- Implement user registration and login functionality
- Secure routes to ensure only authenticated users can access the application

### 2. Task Management

- Allow users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks
- Implement task status changes (e.g., "Backlog", "To Do", "In Progress", "Done")
- Enable users to add comments to tasks
- Implement functionality to assign tasks to one or more users

### 3. User Management

Implement CRUD operations for user accounts. Allow users to edit their own profile information.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (React)

- Use functional components and hooks
- Implement proper state management (e.g., Context API or Redux)
- Create reusable components for tasks, comments, and user profiles
- Implement form validation for user input

### Backend (NestJS)

- Create RESTful API endpoints for all required functionalities
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use Sequelize for database operations
- Implement authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Write unit tests for all services and controllers using Jest

### Database (MySQL)

- Design and implement the database schema for users, tasks, and comments
- Use Sequelize migrations for database schema management

## Design
